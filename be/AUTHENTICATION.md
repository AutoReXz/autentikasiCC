# Authentication Implementation Summary

## Features Added
1. User registration and login with JWT authentication
2. Access token and refresh token implementation
3. Secure routes using middleware
4. User-specific notes (users can only see their own notes)

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `models/user.js`: User model with password hashing
- `controllers/authController.js`: Authentication logic (register, login, refresh token, logout)
- `middleware/authMiddleware.js`: JWT validation middleware
- `routes/authRoutes.js`: Authentication API endpoints
- `utils/generate-jwt-secret.js`: Utility to generate secure JWT secrets

### Modified Files
- `models/index.js`: Added User model and associations
- `models/note.js`: Added userId field for association with users
- `controllers/noteController.js`: Added user filtering to all note operations
- `routes/noteRoutes.js`: Protected routes with authentication middleware
- `app.js`: Added auth routes and cookie parser
- `package.json`: Added new dependencies and scripts
- `README.md`: Updated with authentication documentation
- `.env`: Added JWT secrets

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register`: Create new user account
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticate user and receive tokens
- `POST /api/auth/refresh-token`: Get new access token using refresh token
- `POST /api/auth/logout`: Invalidate refresh token
- `GET /api/auth/me`: Get current authenticated user info

### Notes (All now require authentication)
- `GET /api/notes`: Get all notes for authenticated user
- `POST /api/notes`: Create a new note
- `GET /api/notes/:id`: Get a specific note
- `PUT /api/notes/:id`: Update a note
- `DELETE /api/notes/:id`: Delete a note
- `GET /api/notes/category/:category`: Get notes by category

## How It Works

1. **Registration**: User account is created with hashed password
2. **Login**: User provides credentials and receives:
   - Access token (short-lived, 15 minutes)
   - Refresh token (long-lived, 7 days) stored in HTTP-only cookie
3. **API Access**:
   - Client includes access token in Authorization header
   - Server validates token before processing requests
4. **Token Refresh**:
   - When access token expires, client uses refresh token to get new one
   - Refresh tokens are stored in the database and invalidated on logout
5. **Security Measures**:
   - Passwords hashed with bcrypt
   - Tokens signed with secure secrets
   - HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens
   - Protected routes require valid authentication
   - User data isolation (users can only access their own notes)
